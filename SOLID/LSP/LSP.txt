Suppose we have a Interface Bike with 2 methods:
-> turn on engine
-> accelerate

Now suppose we implement in the class motorcycle and DirtBike: 
it works fine.

But,

When we implement it in the class Bicycle. and when we override
the functionality to turn on engine we throw unsupported operation 
exception.
In this way we are narrowing down the functionality of Bike and hence Bike
can't be replace by Bicycle


To solve it we have only very generic functionality in the Bike interface

ie to accelerate.

Then we have another inteface that is MotoredBike Interface which extends from
Bike and has another functionality to turn on engine

Now all the Classes that have functionality to turn on engine must implement
the MotoredBike Interface
