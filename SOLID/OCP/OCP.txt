Consider the previous example. we had Invoice DAO which saved to DB.

No consider that we want to add a functionality to save in file.

Don't touch the already tested code.

rather create a seperate class and extend the previous class if necessary.

To handle this:
1) Make a interface InvoiceDAO with method save.
2) Implement the interface with the 2 classes
 -> DBInvoiceDAO
 -> FileInvoiceDAO
