Lets say we have a class marker.

The marker class it has basic attributes like price name color etc.

Assume there is another class Invoice which has a object of marker.

It has multiple functions like:

1) Save to DB.
2) calculate price.
3) Print invoice.


Now Invoice class needs to be changed for multiple reasons:

1) We want to save in file instead of DB.
2) There is change in logic of calculation of price.
3) There is change in the logic of printing invoice.

Therefore it is clearly voilating the SRP.

To fix this we need to refactor it and make multiple classes to have 
individual Responsibilities. (Check Refactored folder) 

SRP make code 
1) Easy to maintain
2) Easy to Understand
