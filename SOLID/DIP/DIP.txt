Suppose we have two interfaces Keyboard and Mouse
They both have 2 implementations:
-> Wired.
-> bluetooth

If we have a object of wired/bluetooth in the macbook class then we always 
will have only one type of keyboard/mouse 

but,

If we make them generic and then instatiate them using constructor
we will have contol on what kind of keyboard/mouse we want.
