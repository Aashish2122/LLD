Suppose we have a interface which has following methods:
-> Wash Dish
-> Serve Customer
-> Cook Food

Lets say we implement this interface in the class waiter.

Now waiter's job is only to serve and not to wash dish or cook food.

These methods should not be implement by waiters.

hence We break the interface for eg 

Interface WaiterInterface with the methods:
-> Serve Customer and take Order

Interface ChefInterface with the methods:
-> CookFood and decideMenu

Now no extra methods needs to be implemented.
