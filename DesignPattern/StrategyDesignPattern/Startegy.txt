Lets say you have a vehicle class in which you have a method drive()

lets say the base vehicle class is implemented by multiple child 
vehicle classes like: 
offroad
sports
good
passenger

lets say offroad and sports classes have similar functionality of drive 
which is different from the default functionalityof base class.

now since sports and offroad have same functionality it is duplication 
of code.

What we do is we make a interface DriveStrategy with a method drive().

we make two classes NormalDriveStrategy and SportsDriveStrategy with 
different implementation of drive.


Now we make add a DriveStrategy object in the Vehicle class (Vehicle HAS-A
DriveStrategy).

we inject DriveStrategy using constructor injection.

in the default drive method we call the drive method of the injected object.

We can pass the kind of drive DriveStrategy from child classes.


This helps us to scale code as we can have multiple drive strategy in 
Future.

This also reduces code duplication.
