Design Pattern: Principles for object oriented programming through which we
Design manageable,reusable and scalable software 
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) Startegy Design Pattern : Used we see that the sibbling
classes have same code which is not present in the 
base class.
--------------------------------------------------------------
2) Observer Design Pattern: There are two types of object
Observable and Observer. It helps us define subscription 
mechanism to help us notify multiple Observers about state
