Lets say I have an Interface Shape with method draw
Three classes implements it(IS - A):
1) Rectangle
2) Square
3) Circle

Now we have a Shape factory which has a method getShape which returns 
the object of type Shape. It take string as input.

Based on string it returns 
1) Rectangle
2) Square
3) Circle
